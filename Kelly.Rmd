# 1. Introduction

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/E9_eAm2tTns" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

  From above video we can know the professional gamblers can make profit from operators. However how do we broke bankers? There has no free lunch in the World. Kindly refer to below 
  
![*The secret of professional gamblers and hedge fund in sportsbook industry*](./figure/pro-gambler-criteria.jpg)

  Due to my previous research applied \$1 as long as the edge of EM^[Expectation Maximization] odds is over BK^[Odds price offer by Bookmakers] odds and concludes that the staking methods need to be improved.
  
  Here I tried to scrap the odds price from [7M](http://www.7msport.com/) and [NowGoal.com](http://www.nowgoal.com/) website^[You are feel free to read from [WebDriver-DynamicWebpage-Scrapping.](https://github.com/scibrokes/webdriver-dynamicwebpage-scrapping)], and apply Kelly-Criterion Model, from the simulatioin we can know that the EM model is profitable.

  - [Application of Kelly model in English Soccer session 2012/13](http://rpubs.com/englianhu/kelly_eng1213)
  
  Meanwhile, I conduct another resarch project which is [Betting-Strategy-and-Model-Validation](https://github.com/scibrokes/betting-strategy-and-model-validation) to validate the real data from a famous British sportsbook consultancy firm A. You might refer to the research as well. From that research we can know :-
  
  - How do British firm placed bets via agency A.
  - Analyse the trends of the staking.
  - The Profit and loss and money management.
  - The investment portfolio which application of an weight function get the optimal control parameter for dynamical fractional Kelly model.
  
  Below is my previous research paper **®Model** which was more sophiscated than *Dixon-Coles model*. You can refer it and I will just omit the Poison model as you can refer to below paper.^[**®Model** version II will be started in future.]
  
<iframe src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/scibrokes/odds-modelling-and-testing-inefficiency-of-sports-bookmakers/master/Odds%20Modelling%20and%20Testing%20Inefficiency%20of%20Sports-Bookmakers/Odds_Modelling_and_Testing_Inefficiency_of_Sports-Bookmakers.pdf" style="width:5

  Due to the price of operators are flutucate from the initial price until the closed price. Therefore I try to enhance it and looking for the optimal timing for place bets. A weight function will be fit into the staking timing.

# 2. Data

## 2.1 Read Data

  I try to collect the soccer data from session 2010/11 until 12/13^[Collected the soccer data from sesson 2011/12 until 13/14. Bookmakers' odds data from session 2009/10 until 13/14 from both 7MSports and also NowGoal.com] as data research for this paper. Meanwhile, 

```{r load-data, echo = FALSE, results = 'asis'}
## Load and manipulate the dataset.
suppressMessages(library('turner'))

## Saved as RData format file in order to the save the read files time.
load('./data/dataset.RData')

```

  Due to the odds price of operators fluatuate as time goes by, therefore I try to analyse the trend of bookmakers' price for place bets.

# 3. Kelly Criterion

  The Paper *Niko Marttinen (2001)* had conducted a completed research as a professional gambler and directly point that the Kelly portfolio is the best strategy for money management.
  
  - compare fixed stake, full Kelly, ½ Kelly and ¼ Kelly.

  Below *Fabián Enrique Moya (2012)* is another introduced and research on various betting strategies like :
  - Fixed stakes
  - Fixed percentages
  -
